# Code Genius
Hello! Thank you for checking out Code Genius :) Our company was founded at the MIT Launch http://launchsummer.org/ summer program by four high school students hailing 
from Canada and the United States. Within our short time at Launch, we registered over 30 experts and 12 customers and were working on 6 problems.
Unfortunately, when the Launch program ended and the founders left the confines of the MIT campus, Code Genius slowly submerged into deep stealth mode.

This is a new commit of a once private repository containing all the code ever written for Code Genius. Our backend was built entirely with Node.js and the frontend
was simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our domain name codegenius.io expired and we are also no longer paying for hosting with Digital Ocean.

A rehosted link of the frontend interface is here: http://codegeniusio.herokuapp.com/
Note that the backend is buggy and no longer works after the rehosting.
We do, however, have a video demo of our backend features: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zExhdG9Ibzs
